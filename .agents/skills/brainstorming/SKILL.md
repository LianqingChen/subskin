# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

## When to Use

**Use for:**
- Creative work and new features
- Building components or functionality
- Any design decisions
- Requirements gathering
- Project scoping

**Skip for:**
- Already-specified implementation tasks
- Bug fixes with clear solutions

## HARD-GATE

Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

Complete these items in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
6. **Spec self-review** — quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity
7. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review before proceeding
8. **Transition to implementation** — invoke planning-with-files skill

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify

## Read vs Write Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Just wrote a file | DON'T read | Content still in context |
| Starting new phase | Read plan/findings | Re-orient if context stale |
| Error occurred | Read relevant file | Need current state to fix |
| Resuming after gap | Read all planning files | Recover state |

## The 5-Question Reboot Test

If you can answer these, your context management is solid:

| Question | Answer Source |
|----------|---------------|
| Where am I? | Current phase in task_plan.md |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases |
| What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan |
| What have I learned? | findings.md |
| What have I done? | progress.md |
